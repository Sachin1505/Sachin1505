## About Me:


I'm a software developer based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, IN, who is passionate about building mobile applications for Apple devices. I love the development process for building applications, from planning to prototyping to turning those prototypes into working products and getting them in the hands of people all over. I focus a lot on software architecture; how to make maintainable, reusable, and efficient code.
